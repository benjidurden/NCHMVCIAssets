# MVCI Character Compendium

### Application Purpose

The MVCI Character Compendium (title TBD) is the de-facto resource for MVCI frame data, theory discussion, and tech sharing.

### Tech Stack Used

Intended tech stack is currently:

*HTML
*CSS
*Javascript
*MERN (MongoDB, *Express, React, and Node)

*Express backend will have authentication for moderators. Mods will be able to access a changelog, which allows them to revert changes made by users.

### User Stories

As a user, I would like to log onto the MVCI Character Compendium. I'd like to be able to pick my team of characters and be presented with information for each solo character, as well as the characters as teams. The user will also have the option to cycle through tech based on various tags such as meterless, surge, storm, starting bars, etc. 

### Wireframes

Primary focus right now should be creating the character select. Other options such as graphical scaling, mobile, etc. will be explored further down the road.

### Process Planning

[This trello board](https://trello.com/b/KiUDT8Px/nchmvci) was used during the inception of the MVCI Character Compendium. Feel free to give it a look!


### In Conclusion

I hope this app makes learning the game a lot more enticing for beginner players, as well as seasoned veterans.
